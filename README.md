# Semantic Kernel Pet

This project is a pet simulation prototype that uses Microsoft Semantic Kernel to converse with an AI pet and calls the Gemini API directly to generate images. It is built as a Blazor Server web application, serving as both the server and the client.

## About the Project

This application is designed for users to interact with and create an AI pet.
-   **Conversation**: Managed via Semantic Kernel, using a Gemini text generation model to produce the pet's responses.
-   **Image Generation**: When a user describes a pet, the application makes a direct HTTP call to the Gemini image generation API to create an image of the pet, which is then displayed to the user.

## Key Features

-   **AI-Powered Conversations**: Implements natural conversations with an AI pet using Semantic Kernel.
-   **Dynamic Image Generation**: Creates a unique pet image based on user descriptions via a direct Gemini API call.
-   **Integrated Environment**: Manages both backend AI logic processing and frontend UI rendering within a single project using Blazor Server.

## Tech Stack

-   **Framework**: .NET, Blazor Server
-   **AI Interaction**:
    -   **Conversation**: Microsoft Semantic Kernel (AI Orchestration)
    -   **Image Generation**: Direct Gemini REST API call using `HttpClient`
-   **AI Models**:
    -   Google Gemini Pro (for text generation)
    -   Google Imagen (for image generation, model name needs to be specified based on API documentation)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) or later
-   A Google AI Gemini API Key (with permissions for both text and image generation).
